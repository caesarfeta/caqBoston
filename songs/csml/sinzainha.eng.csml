#MA'AM, WHAT ARE YOU SELTING THERE?

Ma'am, what are you selling there?
You sell rice from Maranh√£o
My (slave)master ordered it to be sold
ln the land of Solomon
Xique-xique, Macambira
Play over me
I am the arm of the tide
But l'm also the limitless ocean
Prayer for strong arms
Prayer to Saint Matthew
ln the capoeira roda
The only one who can conquer me is God, my friend...
